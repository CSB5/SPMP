### Versions

Environment used to generate most of the figure can be found under `envs/main.yaml`. A custom graphic library ([seahorse](https://github.com/jsgounot/Seahorse)) has been used for most of the graphical output. Graphics generated here were produced based on the [release alpha](https://github.com/jsgounot/Seahorse/releases/tag/latest). R version is 4.1.0.
